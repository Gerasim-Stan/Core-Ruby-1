MusicEntrepreneurSplitter
=========================

Project will implement the following functions:

1. Concatenating tunes.
2. Cutting tunes.
3. Adding or removing tunes (mp3 files from folder as DB).
4. Lulling start or end of a tune (about 4 secs).
5. GUI (not yet defined).
6. The Algorithm - it will analyze the frequency. I have some ideas about using the extracted information, but I've not decided, yet. It will be used for visualization (as equalizer), or for splitting the tunes in groups, depending on the average beats per second.

I'll write the algorithm 'till the next milestone. After that, I'll try to deal with some of the other stuff. But for now - the algorithm. I'll try to provide some scheme or plan for my next steps 'till end of the second milestone.
